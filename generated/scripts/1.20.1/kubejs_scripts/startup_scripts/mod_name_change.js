Platform.mods.kubejs.name = 'sicklyfox.Dev'
    // All this does is change the mod name that shows up when you look at the tooltip of an item
    // It does not change the actual mod id, just the name that shows up in game
    // So it will still show up as 'kubejs' in JEI and other places, but when you hover over an item it will say 'sicklyfox.Dev' instead of 'KubeJS'
    // This is purely aesthetic and for branding purposes
